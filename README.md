## 🏗️ Architecture

Kidemma follows modern architecture principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

- It uses **Clean Architecture**, dividing the project into well-defined layers such as `domain`, `data`, and `presentation`, promoting clear separation between business logic, data access, and UI.
- The project implements the **Scream Architecture**, a convention whose core principle is that a system’s architecture should make its primary purpose obvious at first glance. In other words, by simply looking at the folder and file structure, it should be clear what the application is for.

This combination ensures the project remains clean, modular, and easy to extend.
